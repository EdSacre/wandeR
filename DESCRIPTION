Title: Spatial Tools for Connectivity and Corridor Mapping
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Edmond Sacre
Maintainer: Edmond Sacre <edmond.sacre@slu.se>
Description: Provides functions for connectivity modelling.  The
    connectivity models are based on graph theory, and model the movement
    of species through space according to a dispersal kernel, least cost
    paths, and spatial barriers (e.g. land for marine species, or roads
    for terrestrial species). Functions are provided for using a degree
    centrality approach, but without the requirement of defining discrete
    habitat patches. These functions can also include measures of habitat
    suitability, quality, coverage, or any other intensity or abundance
    type measure. Functions are also provided for corridor mapping. These
    functions were designed for the modelling of species connectivity,
    but, of course, have many uses outside of ecology, such as in mapping
    the movements of people or diseases.
