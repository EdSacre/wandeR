Title: Spatial Tools for Connectivity and Density Mapping
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Edmond Sacre
Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: This package provides function for connectivity modelling.
    The connectivity models are based on graph theory, and model the movement
    of species through space according to a dispersal kernel, least cost paths,
    and spatial barriers (e.g. land for marine species, or roads for terrestrial
    species).
